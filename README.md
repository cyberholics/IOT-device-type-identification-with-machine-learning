# IOT-device-type-identification-with-machine-learning

An IoT device is any device that is connected to the internet and can collect or transmit data. Hackers can add their own IoT device, or a malicious IoT device, to an organization's network. Once the hacker has added their own IoT device to the network, they can use it to gain access to other devices on the network, steal data, or launch attacks.
Therefore, it is important to identify when a new IoT device has been added to a network and understand what kind of device it is.

Machine learning can be used as a network security solution to identify the types of IoT devices. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on data from known IoT devices to learn the characteristics of these devices. Once the machine learning algorithm has been trained, it can be used to identify new IoT devices that connect to the network.

## Data used
The power of a machine learning solution lies in its training data. Therefore, in this project, I took advantage of datasets generated from IoT device network traffic analysis because, unlike data generated from device fingerprinting, network traffic analysis data cannot be spoofed. 
The data was gotten from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanbyprinciple/iot-device-identification).
